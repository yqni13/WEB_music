simple music player

build with html, css & javascript

Meanwhile the first idea was to enable the user to select music from local storage via audio input in html, this feature was dismissed. Javascript doesn't allow on client side to access user directories. This is only possible from server side to access and would exceed the scope of this side project. Therefore, this music player as well as seen in many other repositories, this music player will use pre-defined music elements.
